 notes: <p>Although the temp was supposedly around 45-50, it felt much colder. It was nice to see the river. Most of it was iceless, but no signs of life in the water. The shore was absolutely chock full of deer tracks and deer poop, and it looked like others had walked my path recently (who knows if they fished). Fished with 1/16oz jig and twisters, some heavy marabou jigs, a tiny spoon, a few inline spinners, but nothing. I bet the fish are still sitting at the bottom waiting for spring like the rest of us.</p>

 THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A TRIP (edit)
 date: 2014-03-12 11:23:29
 notes: <p>Amazing! Spent 2 hours looking for fish- found some big trout immediately in shallow water at the tails of pools, but they wouldnt take anything I was throwing. Hooked one brownie on a beckstrom special in some light riffles, but he threw the hook. Was going to head to a different spot and noticed some fish by the shore- lots of little trout. Kneeled down and tried fishing for them, got some! the key was movement. They refused if the fly was too slow. If they got a chance to look at it they wouldnt take it. Fished under the Childsdale bridge, caught 30 trout. Amazing. The key was a #12 red/white/brown fly (march brownish) fished right at the surface, downstream and retrieved upstream with quick strips. They ignored larger flies. There were some bigger trout in there but they seemed to be eating nymphs.</p>

 notes: <p>Explored- got a creek chub on a wet fly on Little Muskegon River at County Line rd. then went down to another spot (west of 131 on the highway). Hooked into a fish for a minute. Saw some dead fish, looked like walleyes...!? Then went to a park to the east of 131, looked fishy. Caught an 8" rainbow on a beckstrom special. Fished downstream, lots of fish were around. Many missed fish. Got another rainbow and a brown fishing wet flies downstream. Was going to go home, but instead stopped at Cedar Creek. Spooked all the fish right away! Saw some big ones swimming away. West side of the culvert was FULL of fish- all sizes. Maybe even some 14+ inchers. Tough- finally got one on nightcrawler on a nymph.</p>

 date: 2014-03-12 12:22:06
 notes: <p>After a very frustrating hour I finally found out what was in that pool.. Creek chubs! I put on an indicator and a BH nymph. They attacked the indicator and nymph on the first cast to the deepest part of the pool (near the back). It took about 300 more casts to actually hook one, they are super fast little buggers. Also saw some very tiny minnows like ive been seeing in trout streams (steelhead fry?) as well as a few chubs up near the waterfall. They also attacked a dry fly later, but not like that first cast.</p>

 THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A TRIP (edit)
 date: 2014-03-12 12:23:05
 notes: <p>Was driving around, looking for spots. Explored a bit of Buck Creek at Ideal park, super duper shallow. A bit downstream looks good, but super muddy right now. Drove west, found a creek that goes into a lake (connects to the Grand). Seems to be pretty shallow. Found panfish right away, took a few flies to catch them- ended up using a #18 nymph tied with only white thread. 3 bluegills and 1 pretty pumpkinseed. Later caught a nice bass on a white wooly bugger! Jumped a bunch, it was epic. A bit later cast to a feeding carp- got his attention, he actually took 3 swipes at the fly, but I was so excited and took it away from him.</p>

 fixed notes: <p>Was driving around, looking for spots. Explored a bit of Buck Creek at Ideal park, super duper shallow. A bit downstream looks good, but super muddy right now. Drove west, found a creek that goes into a lake (connects to the Grand). Seems to be pretty shallow. Found panfish right away, took a few flies to catch them- ended up using a #18 nymph tied with only white thread. 3 bluegills and 1 pretty pumpkinseed. Later caught a nice bass on a white wooly bugger! Jumped a bunch, it was epic. A bit later cast to a feeding carp- got his attention, he actually took 3 swipes at the fly, but I was so excited and took it away from him.</p>

 notes: <p>Couldnt find any bass.. Finally caught a bunch of bluegill by tying a dropper soft hackle to a 1/8th oz hair jig. They saw the hair jig and hit the soft hackle. Got 12 in quick succession. Fun to use fly fishing techniques on spinning gear, even better to actually catch some fish. Bass were definitely on their beds, hard to tell if they are actually spawning yet though.</p>

 notes: <p>saw plenty of medium sized bass, but couldnt get anybody to bite. brought both spinning gear and fly gear- when I switched to fly gear I caught two little bluegills on an orange and white reverse hackle fly. they were constantly attacking the knot between my leader and tippet- I need to do something about that. found a brand new light action rod in the trash that had the tip broken off- that should be easy enough to fix. whoohoo! at least I beat the skunk.</p>

<p>I let both go. Very excited about what a stonefly might mean.. does it mean the creek is cold water? High quality? Supports lots of fish? Can't wait to find out!</p>

 THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A TRIP (edit)
 date: 2014-03-12 16:32:02
 notes: <p>Drove around looking for new spots, lots of people out fishing on a nice saturday afternoon. Got to this pull off, and there were two cars but both were kayaks. Fished the river a while, caught a tiny brown on a BHPT in a riffle (letting the nymph hang in the current) and then a 8 inch brown smacked a beckstrom special as soon as it hit the water (on a tandem rig with the BHPT). Later, fishing downstream with the same rig, a big brown SLAMMED into my fly and took off downstream. Spooled me! Took about 10 minutes to get it back to me. 14 inch brown trout, beautiful. Not entirely sure which fly it took, I think the beckstrom special. Tried fishing some more, but was so excited couldn't concentrate. Kept the 14 incher and took it home.</p>

 fixed notes: <p>Drove around looking for new spots, lots of people out fishing on a nice saturday afternoon. Got to this pull off, and there were two cars but both were kayaks. Fished the river a while, caught a tiny brown on a BHPT in a riffle (letting the nymph hang in the current) and then a 8 inch brown smacked a beckstrom special as soon as it hit the water (on a tandem rig with the BHPT). Later, fishing downstream with the same rig, a big brown SLAMMED into my fly and took off downstream. Spooled me! Took about 10 minutes to get it back to me. 14 inch brown trout, beautiful. Not entirely sure which fly it took, I think the beckstrom special. Tried fishing some more, but was so excited couldn\'t concentrate. Kept the 14 incher and took it home.</p>

 THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A TRIP (edit)
 date: 2014-03-12 16:33:42
 notes: <p>Day trip with Claire- fished a lot of Tamarack Creek by the park- had trouble finding the fish. Lots of lures/flies caught in trees, Claire caught lots of sticks with a little spinner... Later we both caught crayfish on lures. One actually grabbed my nymph and kept holding on when I pulled it out of the water! Started catching fish when I switched to tossing nightcrawlers with my fly rod. Caught a chub and I think a big brown came out from under some branches swimming after it. Later caught some rainbows where I expected them- in the fast water under white bubbles. Then we stopped at Cedar Creek on the way home; the brookies on the west side spooked as soon as we stuck our heads over the rail. Tried wading for them, they were too spooked. Headed east through the pipe; saw a BIG brookie (brown?) hanging out upstream of a rock right before the pipe. I cast over it and he flew away. Saw some smaller brookies under the log, right at the bottom in the rocks. Tried tossing a tiny bit of nightcrawler upstream in the fast current, letting it drift down. Saw a bigger fish dart downstream, and it was on my line! Managed to catch it, about 9"- kept it for dinner. Cooked it in a foil packet with lime and butter- pretty good, a little fishy. Would be better pan fried.</p>

 THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A TRIP (edit)
 date: 2014-03-12 16:34:28
 notes: <p>first headed to the coldwater and did some exploring, but it was crazy high and totally muddy. Zero visibility. Tried to wade but almost fell into a deep hole. Drove up the beltline to the Rogue, saw some fish sporadically feeding on the surface. Ignored my nymphs and wooly bugger- got a couple fish to investigate a small #14 light deer hair caddis with a red foam hi-vis thing. Went downstream, met a guy who told me of many 20+ inch browns out of the rogue. Worked all the usual spots, got nothing.. Until I tied on an extra long leader (about 12 feet) and a big bushy and dark (#14) deer hair caddis (no hi-vis foam). First nice fast, a 7" rainbow attacked it. So pretty! Later got another one the same way. That was it.</p>

 fixed notes: <p>first headed to the coldwater and did some exploring, but it was crazy high and totally muddy. Zero visibility. Tried to wade but almost fell into a deep hole. Drove up the beltline to the Rogue, saw some fish sporadically feeding on the surface. Ignored my nymphs and wooly bugger- got a couple fish to investigate a small #14 light deer hair caddis with a red foam hi-vis thing. Went downstream, met a guy who told me of many 20+ inch browns out of the rogue. Worked all the usual spots, got nothing.. Until I tied on an extra long leader (about 12 feet) and a big bushy and dark (#14) deer hair caddis (no hi-vis foam). First nice fast, a 7\" rainbow attacked it. So pretty!

 THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A TRIP (edit)
 date: 2014-03-12 16:35:26
 notes: <p>Fished with Mark- started early, about 6:45am. A few bugs (cinnamon caddis?) but not very many fish rising. The water was high and fast, figured there would be fish in slower water. Fished a big eddy, got a nice smallie on my second cast! Olive and black wooly bugger near the bottom. Weighted wooly buggers seemed to be key- we fished them under indicators and got fish dead-drifting them, swinging them, and swimming them. I figured a bigger profile would get the fish's attention. Maybe I was right! I hooked into 2 smallies, and probably 5 trout - netted 1 smallie and 4 trout, Mark got 3 trout. Dark colors seemed better than light colors, although I got one trout on a red wooly bugger tied with pipe cleaner.</p>

 THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A TRIP (edit)
 date: 2014-03-12 16:37:45
 notes: <p>A repeat performance! Tons of trout. Caught them the same was as the day before- #12 white/red/brown wet fly at the top, stripped against the current quickly. Sometimes they took it as soon as it landed, or floated a foot or two. Went exploring to find other fish, and found bigger ones in the same tail of a pool. They wouldnt take anything, but I caught a few fish in riffles downstream. Swinging a brown wet fly with grey wings in the current and retrieving it back in spurts was the key. They smashed into the fly and hooked themselves, and the downstream fight made them feel even bigger. Great fun! The smaller fish seemed to be in slower water near the shore, but the bigger fish were in good spots at the tails of pools. Some in very shallow water, especially near rocks. Got some video too!</p>

Fished the white river for a few minutes, saw fish jumping but couldnt do much with my gear (and no streamers). found a pond, caught a bunch of bluegills. Almost had a little bass, but he spit it out real quick.</p>

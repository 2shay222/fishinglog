 notes: <p>Although the temp was supposedly around 45-50, it felt much colder. It was nice to see the river. Most of it was iceless, but no signs of life in the water. The shore was absolutely chock full of deer tracks and deer poop, and it looked like others had walked my path recently (who knows if they fished). Fished with 1/16oz jig and twisters, some heavy marabou jigs, a tiny spoon, a few inline spinners, but nothing. I bet the fish are still sitting at the bottom waiting for spring like the rest of us.</p>

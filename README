CB's Fishing Log
---------------
What is it?

A php-based fishing log webapp with cool features like automatic weather information,
USGS gauge info, GPS locating, privacy settings, and lots of other cool stuff.

Why?

There are other fishing log webapps, but I don't care for any that I've seen. I decided
to try to make my own, without any real coding experience. This is my learning project!

Does it work?

Yes*. The core feature of recording a fishing trip and lots of information works
pretty well; other features like friendships, RSS feeds, sharing to social media,
and "place pages" for waterbodies are still in progress.
